## Introduction

Hi, my name is Ali Hatem and I am a frontend developer with a focus on building user interfaces using ReactJS. I have a strong foundation in frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am always learning and staying up-to-date with the latest developments in the field. I created this GitHub account to share my projects and collaborate with other developers.

- Another notable repository is a ReactJS-based social media app that I developed as a personal project. It has a real-time chat feature, a newsfeed, and the ability for users to create and join groups.
- I have also contributed to several open-source ReactJS projects, including a library for creating custom dropdown menus and a tool for optimizing images for the web.
